# **Instructions**

Code for Assistive Signals in DNN Classifiers:

1. We can install the Python libraries needed by running in the command line:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Additionally, we used Pytorch3D v.0.4.0 and Pytorch. Follow the corresponding instruction to install the latest Pytorch3D version:

4. You can run the code to generate the FUll Assistive Textures by running in the command line:
    ```bash
    sudo python run_optimization.py
    ```

    Optionally: You can use Jupyter Notebooks to visualize the models created in run_optimization.ipynb or check directly in the **outputs** folder.
